# Architecture Highlights

## Services Layer
The application uses a service-oriented architecture with specialized service components:
- `LoraService`: Handles all LoRA model training and image generation
- `VoiceService`: Manages voice cloning and audio generation
- `GenerationService`: Provides enhanced prompt generation with AI
- `VideoPromptEnhancer`: Specializes in creating detailed prompts for video motion
- `APIUserService`: Handles user management and authentication
- `FilterService`: Applies artistic filters to generations

## Router Structure
The API is organized with distinct routers for different authentication mechanisms:
- `api_router.py`: For API key-based authentication (developer access)
- `web_router.py`: For JWT/session-based authentication (web users)
- `replicate_router.py`: For handling webhooks from Replicate

## Asynchronous Processing
- Background task management for resource-intensive operations
- Webhook handling for model training completion
- Polling mechanisms for status updates
- Queue-based processing for long-running operations

## Development Approach
This project was built with:
- Clean code practices with consistent formatting and naming conventions
- Extensive documentation using docstrings and OpenAPI
- Modular design for easy maintenance and extension
- Separation of concerns between data models, business logic, and API endpoints
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Security-first approach with proper authentication and input validation
